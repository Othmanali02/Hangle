Hangle is a daily game of Hangman for countries. Each day there will be a different country chosen randomly from a database of over 200 countries. You have to guess which country it is with the least number of mistakes. Every incorrect letter you try will turn red, and the stick-man drawing will have another part drawn. You will have Seven trys before the drawing is complete, and the stick-man is hanged.
